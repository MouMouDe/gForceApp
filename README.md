# gForce App

## Overview
gForce App is the hub application for other applications to interact with gForce. 
It also provides utilities for users setting, firmware upgrading and diagnosing 
gForce. 

The design principle of this application is to make it platform portable by using 
HTML5 as its upper logic, as well as [gForce SDK][gForceSDK] its foundation, 
although so far its foundation is still the Android BLE 
[gForce Data Protocol][gForceDataProtocol]!

You are welcome to hack this application as you desire :)
